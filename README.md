I am looking at Spotify's 'coffeehouse' playlists and  What are the characteristics of these playlists? I am using the following playlists for this research:

  **Coffeehouse:**
  
    1. Coffeehouse - Feel the vibe of the Coffeehouse playlist, full of relaxing singer-songwriter an pop music.    
    2. 't Koffiehuis - 'n Bakkie en gemoedelijke muziek op de achtergrond.    
    3. Your Favorite Coffeehouse - Curl up in your favorite spot with some sweet, mellow tunes...
  
 **On the Road:**
 
    1. Classic Road Trip Songs - The ultimate playlist to fuel your good mood while on the road.
    2. Onderweg - Met deze playlist heb je altijd de beste hits bij de hand voor onderweg.
    3. Songs to Sing in the Car - Sing along and enjoy the drive...
