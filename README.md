I am looking at Spotify's 'coffeehouse' and 'on the road' playlists. A coffeehouse is a pleasant place where you can talk, work or read while enjoying a cup of coffee. You will probably listen to easy, mellow songs here. But when you're on the road (whether you're alone or with friends, you go to work or are on a holiday), you have to kill time while going from A to B. Since the car is a private place, you might listen to uplifting, sing-along songs. What are the characteristics of these playlists and in what way do they differ? I am using the following playlists for this research:

  **Coffeehouse:**
  
    1. Coffeehouse - Feel the vibe of the Coffeehouse playlist, full of relaxing singer-songwriter an pop music.    
    2. 't Koffiehuis - 'n Bakkie en gemoedelijke muziek op de achtergrond.    
    3. Your Favorite Coffeehouse - Curl up in your favorite spot with some sweet, mellow tunes...
  
 **On the Road:**
 
    1. Classic Road Trip Songs - The ultimate playlist to fuel your good mood while on the road.
    2. Onderweg - Met deze playlist heb je altijd de beste hits bij de hand voor onderweg.
    3. Road Trip - Go on a weekend getaway with your barkada and your favorite hits!
