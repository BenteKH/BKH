## My Corpus
I am looking at Spotify's 'coffeehouse' and 'on the road' playlists. A coffeehouse is a pleasant place where you can talk, work or read while enjoying a cup of coffee. You will probably listen to easy, mellow songs here. But, when you're on the road, you have to kill time while going from A to B (whether you're alone or with friends; you go to work or are on a holiday). Since the car is a private place, you might listen to uplifting, sing-along songs. What are the characteristics of these playlists and in what way do they differ? I am using the following playlists for this research, composed by Spotify and Digster Nederland:

  **Coffeehouse:**
  
    1. Coffeehouse - Feel the vibe of the Coffeehouse playlist, full of relaxing singer-songwriter an pop music.    
    2. 't Koffiehuis - 'n Bakkie en gemoedelijke muziek op de achtergrond.    
    3. Your Favorite Coffeehouse - Curl up in your favorite spot with some sweet, mellow tunes...
  
 **On the Road:**
 
    1. Classic Road Trip Songs - The ultimate playlist to fuel your good mood while on the road.
    2. Onderweg - Met deze playlist heb je altijd de beste hits bij de hand voor onderweg.
    3. Road Trip - Go on a weekend getaway with your barkada and your favorite hits!
    
# Findings
 
The Coffehouse playlists have a mean track popularity of 52.38 (SD = 25.751), whereas the On the Road playlists have a higher mean track popularity of 61.68 (SD = 29.766). This makes sense, since the On the Road playlists contain more songs that everyone can sing along to, and are thus familiar to a large audience. I expect, then, that the danceability of On the Road playlists is much higher as well, but there is not a huge difference (0.6051 [SD = 0.191] > 0.5495 [0.237]). 

Characteristic for mellow Coffeehouse songs is acousticness (0.6589, SD = 0.347). The playlists contain mostly easy, soft songs that are accompanied by piano or guitar. The acousticness of these playlists is thus, as expected, much higher than for On the Road playlists (0.2932, SD = 0.353).
