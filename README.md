## My Corpus
I am comparing Spotify's morning (breakfast) and evening (dinner) playlists. What are the characteristics of these playlists? What marks the difference between the two? I am using the following playlists for this research:

  **Breakfast:**
  
    1. Morning Stroll - Get away from the maddening crowds with this peaceful pop mix.
    
    2. Mellow Morning - Have a quiet morning with this mix of something familiar and something new.
    
    3. Morning Acoustic - Rise & shine with the perfect blend of folk and acoustic.
  
  **Dinner:**
  
    1. Dinner with Friends - Having friends over for dinner? Here's the perfect playlist.
    
    2. Dinner Music - Dinner music that includes well known and new tracks.
    
    3. Feel Good Dinner - An uplifting yet tasteful dinner playlist with a guaranteed feel good vibe.
